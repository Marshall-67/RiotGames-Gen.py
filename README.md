### [Bunk] Riot Games Account Generator w/ Captcha Support ###


A script that automates the process of creating a League of Legends account through the official website.

**Reason**

*Testing out selenium/python, This project took a couple of hours to complete and i don't really plan on maintining it as it should be pretty straight forward to do yourself*

**Features**

1. Captcha solving Via NOPECHA plugin
2. Email support using xitroo.com
3. Saves account information to accounts.txt


**Requirements**

- [Captcha Solving Plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nopecha-captcha-solver/dknlfmjaanfblgfdfebhijalfmhmjjjo )

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Selenium
- undetected_chromedriver

**Installation**

- Clone or download the repository to your local machine
- Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt

- You must aqquire the nopecha.crx file from the nopecha extension. this is pretty simple to do with a google search, however i will not be including the file in this code

**Usage**

- Edit the options in the script to customize the Chrome options, such as window size and extensions
- Run the script by using python main.py
- The script will open a Chrome window and navigate to the sign up page. It will then generate random account information and fill out the form. If a CAPTCHA challenge is encountered, it will be automatically solved using anycaptcha.
Once the form is submitted, the script will print a message indicating that the account creation was successful.
